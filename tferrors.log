WARNING:tensorflow:From /Users/claudio/Projects/code2seq/reader.py:147: to_int64 (from tensorflow.python.ops.math_ops) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Use tf.cast instead.
WARNING:tensorflow:From /Users/claudio/Projects/code2seq/reader.py:257: to_float (from tensorflow.python.ops.math_ops) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Use tf.cast instead.
WARNING:tensorflow:From /Users/claudio/Projects/code2seq/env/lib/python3.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/data/ops/dataset_ops.py:1419: colocate_with (from tensorflow.python.framework.ops) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Colocations handled automatically by placer.
WARNING:tensorflow:From /Users/claudio/Projects/code2seq/model.py:705: LSTMCell.__init__ (from tensorflow.python.ops.rnn_cell_impl) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
This class is equivalent as tf.keras.layers.LSTMCell, and will be replaced by that in Tensorflow 2.0.
WARNING:tensorflow:From /Users/claudio/Projects/code2seq/model.py:719: bidirectional_dynamic_rnn (from tensorflow.python.ops.rnn) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Please use `keras.layers.Bidirectional(keras.layers.RNN(cell))`, which is equivalent to this API
WARNING:tensorflow:From /Users/claudio/Projects/code2seq/env/lib/python3.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/ops/rnn.py:443: dynamic_rnn (from tensorflow.python.ops.rnn) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Please use `keras.layers.RNN(cell)`, which is equivalent to this API

WARNING:tensorflow:From /Users/claudio/Projects/code2seq/env/lib/python3.7/site-packages/tensorflow/python/ops/rnn_cell_impl.py:1259: calling dropout (from tensorflow.python.ops.nn_ops) with keep_prob is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Please use `rate` instead of `keep_prob`. Rate should be set to `rate = 1 - keep_prob`.
WARNING:tensorflow:From /Users/claudio/Projects/code2seq/model.py:816: dense (from tensorflow.python.layers.core) is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
Instructions for updating:
Use keras.layers.dense instead.

Instructions for updating:
This class is equivalent as tf.keras.layers.StackedRNNCells, and will be replaced by that in Tensorflow 2.0.
